script.screensaver.Image
========================

XBMC screensaver that just shows the XBMC logo.

The plugin was made to make XBMC (Frodo) not take 47% CPU when idle, which all
other default screensavers did.

Based on [script.screensaver.Nyancat](https://github.com/dersphere/script.screensaver.nyancat).
